# Space Revamp Plan

Owner-approved design for rebuilding the space system so it matches the combat upgrade (`2fa527816`, "Feature/combat upgrade (#2277)"). The decisions came out of a design interview with the owner; every one of them is final unless this file marks it as a number to draft. The work is handed to an implementing agent.

Everything in this plan ships in **one release**. The workstreams in section 14 organize the work, not the release.

Delete this file after release, the way the combat upgrade deleted its plan documents (`dee01b4fe`). Lasting rules move into the owning guides (section 15).

## 1. Read first

Before any work, read `AGENTS.md` and these guides, plus every guide named in the section you are working on:

- `Readmes/SkillPerkStandards.md`: perk structure, mechanical contracts, balance evidence, descriptions.
- `Readmes/CodingStandards.md`: stat-driven gameplay (perks grant `StatType` values; no perk-name switches), Module JSON, TLK and 2DA.
- `Readmes/ContentStandards.md`: item, enemy, loot and ship-access standards.
- `Readmes/DesignBibleWorkbookRules.md`: the Bible is edited at the zip/XML level only, on one branch.
- `Readmes/Migrations.md`: one migration per release, server before player, saved-data item sweeps.
- `Readmes/PullRequests.md`, `Readmes/AgentEnvironment.md`, `Readmes/InEngineVisualVerification.md`, `Readmes/EngineTesting.md`.

**Standing rules for this project:**

- **The Design Bible comes first.** Every number this plan leaves open is drafted in the repo copy of `design/bible/SWLOR Design Bible.xlsx`, sent to the owner for approval, and only then coded. The owner uploads Bible changes to Google; agents never do.
- **No ground ability works in space, and no space ability works on the ground.** These are two separate systems. Ground stats are already stripped on entering space (`Space.EnterSpaceMode`); keep that.
- **No perk unlocks equipment.** Every hull and module is gated by a `RequiresSkill` item property, the same as ground gear.
- **Every new value outside an existing standard needs owner approval.** This plan sets the structure; section 17 lists the numbers still to be approved.

## 2. Decisions at a glance

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Skills | Piloting (kept), Gunnery (new), Ship Systems (new). Space mining and salvage move to Gathering. All count toward the 400 skill cap. |
| Gating | Hulls and modules use `RequiresSkill`. The four unlock perk lines are deleted. |
| Perks | Each space skill gets 2 styles of 60 SP on the ground template: abilities, stances, traits, capstone. |
| Hulls | Size (Small/Medium/Large/Capital) x role, one stat block per role, Piloting gates 0/10/25/40. No hull tiers. |
| Looks | Called **Hull Designs**. Any existing hak model can be a design. Rare designs come from Design Schematics. Starports **Refit** designs. |
| Slots | High / Mid / Low. No configuration slot. |
| Modules | About 20 families, an item every 5 ranks (0-45), rank-50 named boss modules. A weapon fires at its hull's size. |
| Crafting | A new Engineering component layer with trade-off traits. Research blueprints work for hulls and modules. |
| Combat | Shared ground rules: crits, one Attack and one Defense, EM/Thermal/Explosive resistances, shared status effects, threat, PvP rules. |
| Attributes | AGI accuracy/evasion, PER attack/crit, VIT hull defense, WIL shields/capacitor/repair, MGT STM for maneuvers, SOC command and trade prices. |
| Activation | Modules with a cycle are toggles that fire themselves each cycle and switch off when they can't fire. Lit icons show what's on, and a Ship HUD shows targets. |
| Crew | Stations on Large and Capital hulls, with droid crew. Ships at launch. |
| Death | Modules drop only on PvP deaths. Everyone aboard ejects in escape pods and takes the normal XP debt. Cargo spills. |
| Enemies | Every NPC ship gets a size and a role behavior. New groups: pirates, customs patrols, Hutt enforcers, derelict defenses, convoys, aces. |
| World | 3 new small-ship zones with 3 new materials. Salvage from wrecks. Starlane fixes. Size limits on docking. |
| Trade | Cargo held as ship data, about 20 commodities, dock exchanges with moving prices, contraband and customs, pirates, freight contracts, faction standing, city tariffs. |
| Migration | Every character gets one Rebuild Token. Piloting perks are refunded. Ships and modules convert to their new equivalents. |

## 3. Current state

Paths are relative to `SWLOR.Game.Server/`.

- **Skill:** `SkillType.Piloting = 7` (`Service/SkillService/SkillType.cs`), Utility, rank 50, counts toward the cap, `CombatPointCategoryType.Exempt`.
- **Perks** (`Feature/PerkDefinition/PilotingPerkDefinition.cs`):
  - Unlock lines: Starships, Defensive Modules, Offensive Modules, Mining Modules (5 levels each).
  - Others: Energy Management I-II, Starship Mining I-II, Intuitive Piloting.
- **Engine:** `Service/Space.cs` (about 2,500 lines), `Service/SpaceModuleRecast.cs`, and `Service/SpaceService/*`.
  - **Becoming the ship:** the player turns into the ship, and a pilot copy sits at `pilot_chair` in the interior.
  - **Modules on the hotbar:** modules become feats `ShipModule1-30`. High slots map to feats 1-10 and Low slots to 11-20; feats 21-30 are free.
  - **Running costs:** capacitor pays for modules, and there is a 2 s global recast.
- **Hulls** (`Feature/ShipDefinition/PlayerShipDefinition.cs`):
  - 17 player hulls in T1-T5 pairs, plus 10 capitals with identical stats.
  - Role comes from a single configuration module.
  - Enemy hulls: `NPCShipDefinition.cs` and `Feature/SpaceObjectDefinition/NPCSpaceObjectDefinition.cs`.
- **Modules:** `Feature/ShipModuleDefinition/*` (High, Low and Config slots).
  - **Requirements:** gated by perks through `ShipDetail.RequiredPerks` and `ShipModuleDetail.RequiredPerks`.
  - **Examine stamping:** `Space.ApplyShipModuleExamineDetails` and `ApplyShipExamineDetails` stamp `UseLimitationPerk` onto items when they are examined.
- **Combat:** `Combat.CalculateHitRate` and `Combat.CalculateDamage` are already shared with the ground.
  - Missing: crits, resistances, status effects and PvP checks.
  - Per-type attack and defense: separate values for EM, Thermal and Explosive.
- **Storage:** `Entity/PlayerShip.cs`.
  - `SerializedItem`: the deed.
  - `Status` (`ShipStatus`): `HighPowerModules`, `LowPowerModules` and `ConfigurationModules`, each a dictionary of `ShipStatusModule`.
  - `PlayerHotBars`: one saved hotbar per player.
- **Crafting:**
  - Recipes: `Feature/RecipeDefinition/EngineeringRecipeDefinition/*`. Module recipes use only refined ore plus electronics. Electronics come only from loot.
  - **Reserved ores:** Ochne, Croknor, Hemorgite and Bisteiss are reserved for tier 6 and later. **Do not use them.**
- **Unused hooks this plan uses:**
  - `AttachCamera` (`SWLOR.NWN.API/NWScript/CameraFunctions.cs`).
  - `VisibilityPlugin`.
  - `MarketRegionType` regions.
  - The faction service (8 factions, standing from -5000 to +5000).
  - `NWNX_ON_STORE_REQUEST_*` subscriptions with no handlers.
  - `Quest.RegisterRuntimeQuest`.
  - About 100 unused ship models in `SWLOR_Haks/sw_2da/appearance.2da` (most in `sw_cr_vehicle/`).

## 4. Skills

| Skill | ID | Gates | Rank adds | Combat point category |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Piloting | 7 (kept) | Hull sizes; Afterburner, Thrusters and Cargo Expander modules | Evasion, speed | Exempt (full XP from every space kill, like Armor on the ground) |
| Gunnery | new (next free ID, 53 today) | Weapons, Targeting Computer, Damage Amplifier | Accuracy, attack, crit | New `Starship` category (split by contribution) |
| Ship Systems | new (54 today) | Shields, hull, capacitor, repairers, electronic warfare, tackle, Smuggling Compartment | Shield regen, capacitor regen, repair amount | New `Starship` category |
| Gathering | 11 (kept) | Mining Laser, Strip Miner, Salvager | Yield | Gathering XP from mining, gas harvesting and salvage |

- **Skill attributes:** Utility category, rank 50, active, `ContributesToSkillCap = true`.
- **Category value:** add `CombatPointCategoryType.Starship`. The loop in `Service/CombatPoint.cs` picks up new values automatically.
- **Mining rank:** a Mining Laser's `RequiresSkill` follows the module rank schedule in Gathering. The asteroid tier check still applies.
- **Why each skill is worth taking:**
  - **Minimum builds:**
    - Damage pilot: Piloting + Gunnery (100 ranks).
    - Tank or support pilot: Piloting + Ship Systems (100 ranks).
    - Full solo pilot: all three (150 ranks).
    - Crew member: one station skill (50 ranks).
  - **Piloting is not a tax.** It owns gear (propulsion, cargo), maneuvers, and command, and it earns XP from trade.
- **XP rules:**
  - The XP range must cover the longest weapon range. Today it's 40 m against a 55 m missile.
  - Crew earn XP in their station's skill.
  - Completed freight contracts and exchange sales give Piloting XP, scaled by route length and orbit danger. Price flooding and contract limits stop back-and-forth farming.
  - PvP gives no XP (unchanged).

## 5. Attributes in space

| Attribute | Space job |
|---|---|
| AGI | Accuracy and evasion (as today) |
| PER | Weapon attack and crit |
| VIT | Hull defense (as today) |
| WIL | Max shield, max capacitor, repair strength |
| MGT | The pilot's own STM, which pays for maneuvers and physical station actions |
| SOC | Command abilities and auras; better exchange prices; repair discount (as today) |

- **Intuitive Piloting** (WIL in place of PER for attack) is removed and refunded, since WIL now has its own job.
- **FP** is not used in space.
- **Space ability costs:** STM or ship capacitor. Modules keep costing capacitor.
- **Regen:** STM regen keeps its ground pacing unless the Bible draft proves maneuvers need their own rate. If they do, add a space-specific stat; never change ground STM.

## 6. Perks and abilities

### Template

Each space skill has two styles of 60 SP, the same as a weapon skill.

- **SP schedule** (rank -> SP): 2->2, 5->2, 8->2, 10->2, 12->2, 15->4, 18->3, 20->4, 22->4, 25->4, 28->3, 30->4, 32->3, 35->2, 38->4, 40->5, 45->4, 50->6.
- **Row mix per style:** 3 ranked abilities, 2 general traits, 3 cross-skill traits, 1 stance and 1 capstone. Each style opens with a rank-2 ability and ends with a rank-50 capstone.
- **Shared rules:**
  - The ground button budget applies: 4-6 distinct active buttons per style.
  - One stance at a time.
  - The hard crowd-control rules apply.
  - Power by source runs: always-on passive < conditional passive < active/stance < capstone.

### Styles

| Skill | Style | Identity | Signature mechanic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Piloting | **Ace** | Evasion dogfighting | Maneuvers (evasive roll, burst, reverse) that turn dodges into accuracy and crit windows |
| Piloting | **Wing Commander** | Command | SOC-scaled auras and orders for nearby allied ships, a formation stance, bonuses for crew aboard |
| Gunnery | **Broadside** | Sustained energy fire | An overcharge rhythm for lasers, ion and beams |
| Gunnery | **Ordnance** | Missiles and torpedoes | Volleys and lock-on; burst against big hulls |
| Ship Systems | **Bulwark** | Tank | A threat stance, hardening, emergency shields |
| Ship Systems | **Operator** | Support and control | Remote repair, capacitor transfer, jamming, target painting |

- **Gathering:** add space mining, gas harvesting and salvage perks inside its existing tree. Starship Mining I-II are refunded.

### Implementation rules

- **Abilities:** space abilities use the shared ability system with `.CanBeUsedInSpace()` (`Service/AbilityService/AbilityBuilder.cs:105`). No ground ability gets that flag.
- **Source:** abilities act from the ship. Range, line of sight, threat and damage source are all the ship's.
- **Perk effects:** perks grant `StatType` values that the shared space code reads. Add space `StatType`s as needed (`Service/StatService/StatType.cs`) following the StatType rules in `CodingStandards.md`. There is no `Perk.GetPerkLevel` check in space code; today's Energy Management check at `Space.cs` ~1310 goes away.
- **Bible rows:** the implementing agent drafts row-by-row perks (names, ranks, costs, cooldowns, descriptions) in new **Gunnery** and **Ship Systems** tabs and a rewritten **Piloting** tab, using the existing perk-table columns. The owner approves before code.
- **IDs:** reserve feat, spell, `spells.2da` and TLK IDs following `AbilityTargeting.md`.

## 7. Hulls

### Size x role grid

| Size | Piloting | Roles and built-in bonus |
|---|---|---|
| Small | 0 | **Fighter**: weapon damage, most High slots. **Interceptor**: fastest; stronger, longer-range tackle. **Bomber**: torpedo damage. |
| Medium | 10 | **Gunship**: threat and resistances. **Logistics**: remote repair amount and range. **Mining Barge**: mining yield. **Light Freighter**: big interior, cargo, passengers. |
| Large | 25 | **Frigate**: heavy combat. **Industrial**: strip mining and salvage. **Heavy Freighter**: largest non-capital interior and hold. |
| Capital | 40 | **Cruiser**: line combat, capital weapons. **Command Ship**: command aura range and strength. |

- **Stat blocks:** one per role, with no tiers. Power grows through module ranks and the pilot's skills and perks, never through a better copy of the same hull.
- **Each hull defines:**
  - High/Mid/Low slot counts.
  - Base hull, shield and capacitor.
  - Speed and evasion.
  - Signature (size).
  - Cargo hold.
  - Interior layout (structure and storage limits).
  - Repair-cost multiplier.
  - Crew stations.
- **Built-in bonuses** replace the configuration modules. They use stats, not role-name switches.
- **Speed:** add per-hull movement through `Stat.ApplyCreatureMovementRate` (today every ship is 1.0).
- **Shield regen:** make it per second, increasing with size and WIL. Today larger hulls regenerate slower.

### Size rules

- **Size penalties:**
  - A weapon larger than its target loses hit chance for each size step.
  - A weapon smaller than its target loses damage for each size step.
  - Bomber torpedoes ignore the size penalty.
- **Access:**
  - Some zones admit only Small and Medium hulls (section 12).
  - Docking limits by size:
    - Capital hulls dock only at Veles, Mon Cala, Anchorhead, Smuggler's Moon Station and Korriban.
    - Every NPC dock takes Large and smaller.
    - Player-city starports take Large at upgrade level 3 and Capital at level 5. This gives the starport upgrade a purpose beyond its repair discount.
    - Ships already docked somewhere too small stay there until they leave.
- **Cost:** the repair bill scales with size.

### Hull Designs and Refit

- **Naming:** looks are **Hull Designs**. The unlock item is a **Design Schematic: <name>**, which unlocks that design for the character permanently. Changing design at a starport is a **Refit** and costs a fee.
- **Common and rare designs:**
  - Each role has a few common designs every character has.
  - Rare designs come from schematics. These include Aurek, Sith Fighter, Cutlass, Basilisk and the faction capitals. Today `recipe_aurek`, `recipe_sfight` and `recipe_basilisk` have no source.
- **Models:** only existing hak models are used. New models go to the Trellis2 list (section 20).
- **Starting design map** (the implementing agent verifies each model renders correctly at ship scale with client evidence before assigning it):

| Role | Candidate models (appearance row) |
|---|---|
| Fighter | Striker 10057, Republic Striker B 10072, Sith Striker A/B 10089/10090, Pirate Fighter 10183, Liberty Fighter 10199; rare: Aurek 10074, Sith Fighter 10092, Cutlass 10161 |
| Interceptor | Condor 10055, Sith Scout A/B/C 10086/10087/10088, Republic Scout B/C 10069/10070, Republic Infiltrator A-D 10064-10067, Starflier 10114 |
| Bomber | Republic Bomber A/B 10058/10059, Sith Bomber A/C 10077/10079, Chela Bomber 10149 |
| Gunship | Neutral Gunship 10056, Republic Gunship B/C 10062/10063, Sith Gunship A/B/C 10080-10082; rare: Basilisk 10120 |
| Logistics | Support Ship 1-3 10101-10103, Repair Ship 10182 |
| Mining Barge | Y8 Miner 10152, Mining Ship 10185 |
| Light Freighter | Neutral Dropship 10054, XS Freighter 10146, Small Transport 10186, Trandoshan Transport 10147, Jedi Transport 10119 |
| Frigate | Republic Foray 10075, Republic Hammerhead 10076, Neutral Foray/Hammerhead/Praetorian 10133/10134/10136, Sith Foray/Hammerhead/Praetorian 10137/10138/10140 |
| Industrial | Heavy Lifter 10188 |
| Heavy Freighter | Freight Train 10189, Large Transport 10187, Luxury Liner 10111 |
| Cruiser | Thranta x3 10123/10135/10139, YZ2500 10145, Chiss Trireme 10162, Kusari Gunship 10207, Hutt Corvette 10108, Jehavey 10154, Crusader 10260, Mando Cruiser 10121, Bothan Cruiser 10099 |
| Command Ship | Armored Transport 10218, Republic Valor 10117, Paladin 10125, Centurion/Zenith 10128/10129, Interdictor 10143 |

## 8. Modules

### Slots

- **Rows:**
  - High: hotbar feats 1-10.
  - Low: feats 11-20.
  - Mid (new): feats 21-30 (`ShipModuleFeat.cs` already defines `ShipModule21-30` and the `ife_sm21-30` icons).
- **Data model:** add `MidPowerModules` to `ShipStatus`.
- **Activity:** active modules can sit in any row.
- **Removed:** the configuration slot.
- **Fitting limits:** slot counts plus capital-only weapons; capacitor is the running cost.
- **Slot tags:** each slot carries a tag, **Helm** or a station (Gunner, Engineer, Sensors), for crew (section 10).

### Activation: toggles and auto-fire

Toggled modules are the ship's auto-attacks; perk abilities are the buttons, as on the ground.

- **Toggles:** every module with a cycle is an on/off toggle that fires itself each time its cycle ends. That covers:
  - weapons (missiles while ammo lasts)
  - Mining Lasers, Salvagers and Gas Harvesters
  - repairers and capacitor transfer
  - Jammers, Target Painters, Ion Webs and Interdictors
  - Shield Hardeners and the Afterburner, which pay capacitor each cycle
- **One press:** consumables (Hypermatter Injector) and every perk ability.
- **Targets:**
  - Offensive modules fire at the ship's current target and follow it when the pilot switches targets.
  - Support modules (repairers, capacitor transfer) lock onto the target selected when they were turned on. They keep it until it dies or they are turned off.
- **Auto-off:** a toggled module turns itself off, with one short message, when:
  - its target dies, becomes invalid or leaves range
  - capacitor can't pay its next cycle
  - its ammo runs out
  - its asteroid, gas cloud or wreck is used up
  - the ship leaves space, jumps a starlane or is destroyed
- **No global recast for toggles:** each runs on its own cycle. One-press items and perk abilities follow the ground ability rules.
- **Balance:** every fitted module now fires every cycle. Sustained damage on hulls with many slots roughly doubles compared to today, where the 2 s global recast limited how many modules a pilot could cycle. Rebalance damage, capacitor cost and cycle time for each family in the Bible draft.
- **State:** toggle state lives in `ShipStatus.ActiveModules`, which exists but is unused today. One auto-fire loop drives players and NPCs (folding in `ProcessSpaceNPCAI` firing). It runs at sub-second resolution so cycles aren't held back by the 1 s ship tick.
- **Lit icons (required):** a module that is on shows a lit variant of its icon: the same art with an "active" border, generated with the icon tools (`IconStandards.md`). It is swapped through the slot texture override that `Space.ApplyShipModuleFeat` already uses, and the cooldown sweep runs each cycle. Every module family and rank needs both variants, and client evidence must show on, off and auto-off states.
- **Ship HUD:** a NUI window built to `NuiLayoutRules.md`, `GuiWindowAuthoring.md` and `skills/swlor-gui-window-generation/SKILL.md`. It shows:
  - the current target with its hull and shield
  - every module that is on, with its target and cycle progress
  - a **Retarget** button on each support module, which locks it to the current target
  - an **All Weapons** on/off button, also available as a hotbar feat

  The HUD exists so support-module locks are never confusing: a player can always see what each module is aimed at and change it in one click.

### Families

*New* marks a new family. Existing families keep their identity and move rows as listed.

| Row | Owner | Families |
|---|---|---|
| High | Gunnery | Laser Cannon, Ion Cannon, Beam Cannon, Missile Launcher, Torpedo Launcher (today's proton bomb, expanded), *Point-Defense Turret* (always fires as Light), capital weapons (Turbolaser, Quad Laser, Laser Battery, Storm Cannon, Assault Concussion Missile) |
| High | Gathering | Mining Laser, Strip Miner, *Salvager*, *Gas Harvester* |
| Mid | Ship Systems | Shield Booster, Shield Repairer, *Shield Hardener*, Capacitor Battery, Hypermatter Injector, *Ion Web*, *Interdictor* (target can't jump, dock or leave space for a while), *Jammer*, *Target Painter*, capital Bulwark, Repair Field and E-War arrays |
| Mid | Piloting | *Afterburner* |
| Mid | Gunnery | Targeting Computer |
| Low | Ship Systems | Hull Plating, Hull Repairer, Resist Plating (one type or all types), *Capacitor Regulator*, *Smuggling Compartment* |
| Low | Gunnery | Damage Amplifier (per type) |
| Low | Piloting | Thrusters, *Cargo Expander* |
| Low | Ship Systems | The six capital passives |

- **Capital modules:** capital weapons and arrays fit only Capital hulls. Hull and shield repairers and the injector now work on capital ships too.
- **NPC-only modules:** variants (`npc_*`) convert to the new families with NPC-level scaling.

### Ranks and size

- **Rank steps:** every family has a distinct item every 5 ranks: 0, 5, 10 ... 45, with in-between stats. Rank N requires rank N in the owning skill.
- **Rank 50:** reserved for named boss modules (section 14).
- **Capital families:** their ladders start at rank 40.
- **Size scaling:** a module's output scales with the size of the hull it's fitted to. A Laser Cannon fires as Light on a Small hull and as Heavy on a Large hull.
- **Exceptions to size scaling:**
  - Point-Defense always fires as Light, so big ships can carry anti-fighter guns.
  - Capital weapons fire as Capital.
  - Torpedoes ignore the size penalty.
- **Item count:** expect about 20 families x 10 steps, roughly 200 items with recipes, icons (`IconStandards.md`) and descriptions.

### Enhancements

- **Starship enhancements** are rebased to the new stats: one Attack, one Defense, resistances, hull, shield, capacitor, regen, accuracy, evasion and cargo.
- **Module enhancements** (`ModuleBonus`) stay.
- **Fix:** subtype 58, which is labelled "Starship - Agility" but builds an ability bonus.

## 9. Combat rules

- **Hit and damage:**
  - Hit chance uses `Combat.CalculateHitRate`, as today.
  - Damage uses `Combat.CalculateDamage` with one ship Attack and one ship Defense, replacing today's three per-type pairs.
- **Accuracy and evasion:** AGI x 3 + Gunnery rank (accuracy) or Piloting rank (evasion), plus hull and modules.
- **Crits:** on, following the ground formula. Gunnery rank stands in for weapon rank, with PER against VIT.
- **Resistances:** add `ResistanceType` Thermal, Explosive and EM, each from -100 to 100. `CombatDamageType` already has Thermal 20, Explosive 21 and EM 22.
- **Status effects:** go through `StatusEffect` with its resistance families.
  - Ion slow uses the Mobility family.
  - Hard crowd control follows the ground rules: cooldown at least 1.5x duration, 30 s maximum, 20 s immunity, no refresh, target caps.
- **Threat:** the `Enmity` service drives NPC targeting, and tank stances use the ground threat pattern.
- **PvP:**
  - A player's ship may attack another player's ship only when the ground rules allow it: like/dislike hostility through `PlayerList` plus the area's PvP setting.
  - The `PvpCombat` ramps and halved hard crowd control apply.
  - Remote repair and buffs follow the same hostility rules.
- **Death:**
  - **Escape pods:** a destroyed ship ejects everyone aboard (pilot, crew and passengers) alive to the dock the ship is towed to. Each takes the normal ground XP debt (`Death.ApplyPenalties`).
  - **Modules:** they drop only on a PvP death, at today's 65% chance, and the attacker can loot them. On a PvE death, modules stay installed.
  - **Cargo:** spills on any death (section 13).
  - **Repairs:** the owner pays a repair bill scaled by hull size. The SOC and starport discounts stay.
- **Global recast:** none for toggled modules (section 8, Activation). One-press items and perk abilities follow the ground ability rules, and each crew member has their own.

## 10. Crew stations

Ships at launch.

- **Stations:**
  - Large hulls: Pilot, Gunner and Engineer.
  - Capital hulls: Pilot, 2 Gunners, Engineer and Sensors.
  - Small and Medium hulls are solo.
- **Slot control:**
  - Gunners toggle the High slots tagged as their turrets and pick their own target, independent of the pilot.
  - The Engineer runs active shield and hull modules, plus a new **power-routing** ability that shifts capacitor regen between weapons, shields and engines.
  - Sensors runs Mid electronic warfare and tackle.
  - The Pilot runs Helm slots, Afterburner, Thrusters and maneuvers. The pilot cannot fire station slots.
- **Boarding a station:**
  - A crew member uses a console placeable in the interior. Their character moves into the space area and is hidden through `VisibilityPlugin`. It is ghosted (passes through things), can't be targeted, and is plot.
  - The camera attaches to the ship with `AttachCamera`, and a copy of them sits at the console.
  - Their hotbar swaps to the station's slots plus their own space abilities.
- **While crewing:**
  - The server keeps the hidden character beside the ship every second and re-attaches the camera after every area transition. The camera drops on transitions.
  - Everything a station does is fired from the ship. The crew member's own rank, attributes and perks set the strength.
- **Droid crew:**
  - A player-built droid (Engineering) can work any station at reduced effect. It turns that station's modules on whenever the pilot has a valid target, and back on after an auto-off once a new valid target is picked.
  - Its logic reuses `ProcessSpaceNPCAI`.
- **Permissions and edge cases:**
  - Add a crew property permission next to `PilotShip`.
  - Handle disconnects at a station, crew leaving mid-fight, and ship death (escape pods).
- **Balance:** a ship crewed by N players must not beat N separate ships. The combat simulator checks this.
- **Wing Commander:** its crew bonuses apply to everyone aboard.

## 11. Enemies

- **Conversion:** every NPC hull gets a size and a role.
  - Size mapping: Fighter, Interceptor and Bomber -> Small; Gunship and Cargo -> Medium; Platform -> Large; capitals -> Capital.
  - Loadouts come from the new families.
- **Unchanged:** the faction ladder (T1 Septra Khanate, T2 Krakenborne, T3 Snowdrift Syndicate, T4 Clan Zel Arun, T5 Red Hand, T6 Imperial) and NPC levels.
- **Role behaviors** are shared AI in `ProcessSpaceNPCAI`:
  - Tank: holds threat and hardens.
  - Logistics: repairs allies.
  - Electronic warfare: jams or paints the top-threat player.
  - Interceptor: webs and interdicts ships that flee.
  - Bomber: hunts the biggest hull.
  - Sniper: kites at max range.
  - Carrier: launches fighter waves.
  - Minelayer.
- **Every faction tier** gets these roles.
- **New groups:**
  - **Pirate raiders**, per tier, who ambush traders (section 13).
  - **Customs patrols:** Republic, Czerka and Sith, in lawful orbits.
  - **Hutt enforcers** on the Smuggler's Moon lanes.
  - **Derelict defenses** in the debris field: droids, turret platforms (unused turret rows 2153/2154) and mines (Mine 10110).
  - **NPC trade convoys** players can raid for cargo. Raiding costs lawful standing.
- **Aces:** one named rare-spawn pilot per orbit, built with `skills/swlor-rare-spawn-generation/SKILL.md`. Each has a unique loot table of Design Schematics, named-module recipes, trophies and components.
- **Encounter types:** patrols, ambushes, convoys, mining-site defense and capital battle events.
- **Rare Sith and Mandalorian capitals** (Harrower, Kandosii and the others) spawn only in T5-T6 orbits.
- **Stats:** draft a space section in the Bible's Enemy Builder Guide, Enemy Stat Presets and related tabs for owner approval. Follow `NpcHitPoints.md` for HP limits.
- **Models:** use unused hak models. Space fauna goes on the Trellis2 list.

## 12. Activities, zones, and materials

- **Mining:**
  - Moves to Gathering: XP, perks and module gating.
  - Fix the mining lock, the strip miner tier check and the yield math (section 16).
  - Mined ore still goes to the pilot's inventory.
- **Gas harvesting:** a Gas Harvester cycles on gas-cloud placeables in the nebula.
- **Salvage:**
  - A destroyed NPC ship leaves a wreck placeable for a few minutes.
  - A Salvager cycles on it the way a Mining Laser cycles on an asteroid. Capital wrecks need a Large or Capital salvager.
  - The killing party has the wreck to itself for 60 s, then anyone can salvage it.
  - **Yields:**
    - **Ship Scrap,** which the Refinery turns into electronics of the wreck's tier. This is the first reliable electronics source.
    - **Salvaged Components,** each carrying a random trait (section 14).
    - **Rare finds** from elite and boss wrecks.
- **Zones:**
  - The 3 Abandoned Station areas (`zomb_abanstation`, `zomb_abanstatio2`, `zomb_abanstatio3`) become Small/Medium-only.
  - Build 3 new Small/Medium-only zones:
    - **Viscara Asteroid Belt** (T1-2): Durelium asteroids.
    - **Mid Rim Nebula** (T3-4): Tibanna Gas clouds.
    - **Korriban Debris Field** (T5): Aurodium salvage and derelict defenses.
  - Each pays better than open orbit.
- **New materials:**
  - **Durelium** (asteroid ore, feeds Hull Frames).
  - **Tibanna Gas** (feeds Emitters and Reactors).
  - **Aurodium** (salvaged ancient alloy; feeds the named rank-50 modules alongside Thorilide).

  Each needs item blueprints, refinery entries where needed, loot tables, icons and `EconomyRestrictedItems.md` coverage.
- **Starlanes:**
  - Add Dantooine-Korriban.
  - Give Smuggler's Moon (`narshadorbit`, unreachable through space today) dangerous lanes to Hutlar and Tatooine.
  - Make the Korriban route return the way it came.

## 13. Trade

- **Cargo:**
  - Cargo is data on `PlayerShip`, never items. It can't enter an inventory, the bank, the market or contracts, all of which are galaxy-wide today.
  - Each hull has a cargo hold in units. Freighters are largest and Small hulls hold almost nothing.
  - A Cargo Expander (Low, Piloting) trades a slot for capacity.
- **Commodities:** about 20, separate from crafting materials.

| Dock | Exports (cheap) | Imports (pays well) |
|---|---|---|
| Viscara | Veles honey, Viscaran crystals, kinrath silk | Machine parts, purified water |
| CZ-220 | Reactor cores, Czerka machine parts | Grain, crystals |
| Mon Cala | Seafood, purified water, hull sections | Silk, timber, neon salt |
| Hutlar | Aracia timber, byysk hides | Medical supplies, reactor cores |
| Tatooine | Jawa salvage, bantha hides | Water, grain, seafood |
| Smuggler's Moon | Moonspice (contraband), neon salt, encrypted data chips (contraband) | Sith relics (contraband), honey, weapons crates (contraband) |
| Korriban | Sith relics (contraband), abdamaryllia extract | Water, data chips (contraband) |
| Dathomir | Witch herbs, beast hides | Machine parts, medical supplies |
| Dantooine | Grain, bantha milk | Hides, timber |

- **Exchanges:**
  - A Trade Exchange NUI window sits at every NPC dock and every player-city starport. It trades with the player's ship docked there.
  - **Prices move:** selling floods a dock and lowers its price, buying raises it, and both recover over a few hours. Price state persists in a new Redis entity.
  - Longer and more dangerous routes pay more.
  - A **HoloNet price board** shows other docks' prices an hour stale.
- **SOC** improves buy and sell prices slightly. There is no trade skill.
- **Contraband and customs:**
  - Lawful docks: Republic (Viscara, Mon Cala, Dantooine), Czerka (CZ-220), Sith (Korriban). Each has its own contraband list. For example, the Republic bans spice, Sith relics and weapons crates.
  - Customs patrols in lawful orbits scan passing ships. If they find contraband, the player pays a fine and loses it, or runs: the patrol turns hostile and lawful standing drops.
  - Black markets at Smuggler's Moon, Tatooine and Hutlar buy contraband at a premium.
  - A Smuggling Compartment (Low, Ship Systems) cuts the scan chance.
- **Risk:**
  - A destroyed ship spills its cargo as containers anyone can scoop for 5 minutes, in PvE and PvP.
  - Cargo above a value threshold can trigger a pirate ambush when the ship enters an orbit or jumps. The chance and squad size scale with cargo value and orbit tier, and every squad includes an interceptor.
- **Freight contracts:**
  - NPC contracts at each exchange: haul a sealed load from A to B by a deadline for a fixed fee and standing.
  - A deposit is forfeited if the load is lost.
- **Factions:** trade switches on the faction service. Czerka (industrial), Republic Military (lawful supply), Hutt Cartel and Smugglers (contraband), Sith Military (Korriban).
  - Standing unlocks better prices and higher-paying contracts.
  - Getting caught smuggling, or raiding convoys, costs lawful standing.
- **City hubs:** a city starport exchange charges a mayor-set tariff paid into the treasury.
- **Earning targets:** measure credits per hour of space combat at each tier first (loot gold plus sold drops), then set:
  - Freight contracts: about 75% of that rate.
  - Open trading: about 100-125%.
  - Contraband: about 150-200%.
  - Price flooding, fees, deposits and cargo loss hold trade to those targets. Exchanges create credits, so this is the inflation guard.

## 14. Crafting, rewards, and the economy

### Component layer

Engineering intermediates that hull and module recipes consume.

- **Families:** Hull Frame, Ship Reactor, Energy Emitter, Ordnance Assembly, Shield Projector, Thruster Assembly, Sensor Suite, Extraction Head.
- **Tiers:**
  - Five material tiers. Items at in-between ranks use their tier's component.
  - Today's capital parts (`capc_*`) become the top band.
  - Name the reactor "Ship Reactor"; `power_core` is already the refinery fuel item.
- **Inputs:** refined ores, metals, electronics, fiberplast, the new materials and salvage.
- **Variants:** each family has 2-3 craftable variants. Each adds a trade-off trait to the finished item, and nothing becomes a strict upgrade. Examples:
  - Energy Emitter: Focused (+accuracy), Overcharged (+damage, +capacitor cost), Efficient (-capacitor cost).
  - Hull Frame: Reinforced (+hull, -speed), Lightweight (+evasion, -hull).
  - Shield Projector: Dense (+max shield), Rapid (+regen).
  - Extraction Head: Bulk (+yield), Precision (+rare-find chance).
- **Salvaged Components:** carry a random trait, sometimes a rare one crafting can't make (for example "Sith-tuned").
- **Recipe levels:** they match the rank schedule. The rule "required rank = recipe level - 3" stays.
- **Hulls:** one Engineering recipe per role, at its size gate level. Starship enhancements remain the way to improve a hull.

### Research

- Extend `IsResearchableRecipe` and the Research Terminal so starship and module recipes can be researched into blueprints: bonus stats, extra enhancement slots, cheaper runs.

### Rewards

- **Named rank-50 modules,** one per main family:
  - They follow the ground Chiro pattern: level-52 recipe unlocks, 2 enhancement slots.
  - Recipe unlocks drop from T6 bosses and aces. The modules need Thorilide and Aurodium.
- **Design Schematics** for rare Hull Designs drop from aces, bosses and rare salvage.
- **Interior trophies and decor:** new `StructureType` entries such as a mounted wreck trophy or a captain's holotable.
- **Ammo variants** for each launcher at each tier:
  - Ion missiles (EM plus slow).
  - Incendiary (thermal damage over time).
  - Seeker (high accuracy).
  - Rare torpedo types from salvage.
- **Achievements:**
  - Explore the Fighter, Corvette and Basilisk interiors (missing today).
  - First capital kill.
  - Trade milestones.
  - First crewed kill.

### Stores and economy

- The dockhand store sells rank-0 modules and starter Small hulls. Its stock above rank 0 is a number to draft (section 17); today it sells Mining Lasers I-IV.
- Every new item source must be registered for `EconomyObtainabilityCoverageTests` and follow `EconomyRestrictedItems.md`.
- Game text uses ASCII punctuation (`CodingStandards.md`).

## 15. Migration

One release, one migration set (`Migrations.md`): server migrations first, then character migrations, then the saved-data item sweep.

- **Rebuild Token for every character**, regardless of skills or perks.
  - Use `CharacterMigration/RebuildTokenGrant.cs` in a new character migration.
  - There is no forced rebuild. Piloting ranks stay as they are; Gunnery and Ship Systems start at 0.
- **Refund every Piloting perk** as SP: Starships, Defensive Modules, Offensive Modules, Mining Modules, Energy Management, Starship Mining, Intuitive Piloting.
  - Use `CharacterRecalculation.RefundPerk` with a login notice.
  - Remove their feats.
  - Clean `UnlockedPerks`.
- **Login notice:** must say plainly that a pilot keeps Piloting but needs Gunnery or Ship Systems ranks to fit anything above rank-0 modules. The free Rebuild Token is the way to move ranks.
- **Items** (inventories, storage, bank, market listings, deeds, installed modules on `PlayerShip`):
  - Old hulls map to the new role whose design matches. Store-sold starter hulls (`sdeed_freighter`, `sdeed_escort`) map to Small roles.
  - Each owner gets that design unlocked.
  - Old module tiers map to the new rank steps: Basic -> 0, I -> 10, II -> 20, III -> 30, IV -> 40.
  - Configuration modules are uninstalled and refunded in credits at their value.
  - Installed modules that no longer fit return to their owner, never deleted.
  - Strip `UseLimitationPerk` and the broken `RequiresSkill(Invalid, 100)` stamps (section 16), and add `RequiresSkill`.
- **Where the item code goes:**
  - Live items: update `EquipmentRequirementMigration` / `EquipmentRequirementCompatibility`, replacing the `SpaceEquipmentLegacyRequirement` skip.
  - Saved data: the `StoredItemSweep` twin, including `PlayerShip` deeds and module dictionaries.
  - Add the legacy kinds to the `SavedDataItemSweep` engine test.
- **Ships:**
  - Rebuild `ShipStatus` for every `PlayerShip` (precedent: `RecalculateAllShipStats` in `git show 2fa527816:SWLOR.Game.Server/Feature/MigrationDefinition/ServerMigrationBase.cs`).
  - Add `MidPowerModules`, move modules to their new rows, and clear `PlayerHotBars`, since feats change.
- **Docked ships:** ships docked somewhere now too small for them stay until they leave.
- **Before migrating:** refund perks before removing their keys. The rebuild UI cannot price undefined perks.

## 16. Bug list

Fix these as part of the rewrite. Most go away with the code that replaces them.

1. Mining laser and strip miner clear the asteroid "being mined" flag right after scheduling, so the lock never holds.
2. Strip miner: no asteroid tier check, no ship-status null check after its delay, and a smaller yield than the laser despite its description.
3. Mining yield uses float division on `ModuleBonus`.
4. Capital configuration modules add and remove different `ModuleBonus` amounts. Configuration modules are removed entirely.
5. Configuration modules are ignored by death, `CanPlayerUseShip` and the unregister guard, and their descriptions disagree with the code. Removed with configs.
6. Storm Cannon is typed `IonCannon`; the `StormCannon` and `CapitalPowerDiverter` enum values are unused.
7. Turbolaser text says two seconds, but the code waits 3 s. It also has `CanTargetSelf`.
8. Quad Laser skips `CanShipFire` and the dead-target check between shots.
9. Larger hulls regenerate shields slower than small ones.
10. The kill XP range (40 m) is shorter than missile range (55 m).
11. Space weapons and damage have no PvP hostility check.
12. `EquipmentRequirementMigration` stamped examined Defensive, Offensive and Mining module items with `RequiresSkill(Invalid, 100)`, because only `PerkType.Starships` was skipped.
13. Starship enhancement subtype 58 is labelled "Starship - Agility" but builds an ability bonus.
14. `recipe_aurek`, `recipe_sfight` and `recipe_basilisk` cannot be obtained. Design Schematics fix this.
15. Missile ammo: `Missile35` is recipe level 25, recipe type names don't match quantities, and the Bible rows are stale.
16. `ShipDetail` Accuracy, Evasion, defenses, IndustryBonus and HasDroidBay are never read. `ShipStatus.ActiveModules` is never read either; it becomes the toggle state (section 8).
17. NPC config modules are stored under negative Low-slot keys. Removed with configs.
18. The asteroid space object points at an item tag ("asteroid") that isn't a registered ship.
19. `PerkType.StarshipBlueprints` (152) is unreferenced.
20. `Readmes/Builders.md` ship builder examples use members that don't exist.
21. Capital ships can't use normal repairers or the injector (section 8 allows them).
22. Smuggler's Moon has no starlanes, and the Korriban route returns to Viscara instead of the way it came (section 12).

## 17. Numbers to draft for approval

Draft each in the Bible, check it with the combat simulator where it affects combat, and get owner approval before code.

- **Hulls:** per-role slots, hull, shield, capacitor, speed, evasion, signature, cargo, interior limits, repair multiplier, built-in bonus sizes.
- **Size rules:** hit-chance and damage penalty per size step.
- **Modules:** stats per family per rank step; capacitor cost, recast and range; Point-Defense and capital values; size scaling factors.
- **Components:** recipes, variant trait sizes, salvaged trait odds.
- **Perks:** every row for Ace, Wing Commander, Broadside, Ordnance, Bulwark and Operator, plus the Gathering space perks.
- **Combat:** STM costs, capacitor and shield regen formulas, crit factors.
- **Activation:** cycle time and capacitor per cycle for every family once the global recast is gone, and the auto-fire loop interval.
- **Crew:** droid crew effectiveness, power-routing amounts.
- **Enemies:** space NPC stat presets per role and tier, ambush odds, convoy and patrol sizes.
- **Trade:**
  - Commodity base prices, flooding and recovery rates, exchange fee.
  - Freight deposits and pay, contraband scan odds and fines, tariff cap.
  - XP per delivery, standing gains.
  - The measured combat baseline and the resulting targets.
- **Repairs:** cost per hull size.
- **Refit:** fee.
- **Dockhand store:** stock above rank 0.
- **IDs:** confirm the new skill IDs (53 and 54) were never used historically, since saved data keys skills by ID.

## 18. Workstreams and order

Everything merges to one integration branch and releases together.

- **Branching:**
  - Create `feature/space-revamp` from up-to-date `origin/master`.
  - Each workstream slice goes on its own branch and pull request into it, with the Codex review loop (`PullRequests.md`).
  - **Bible edits happen on one branch only**, because separate branches that edit the `.xlsx` cannot be merged. Make them on the integration branch, one at a time.
  - Merge `origin/master` into the integration branch regularly.
  - The final pull request goes to `master`.

| # | Workstream | Contents | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 | Bible drafts | Piloting, Gunnery and Ship Systems perk tabs; Starships tab rewrite (hulls, modules, components, traits); space enemy sections; trade tab (commodities, prices) | Owner approval gates W2-W9 numbers |
| W1 | Foundations | Skills, `CombatPointCategoryType.Starship`, space `StatType`s, resistance types, High/Mid/Low and slot tags in `ShipStatus`, removing configs, size x role data model, `RequiresSkill` on space items | - |
| W2 | Combat rules | Shared crit, resist, status and threat; attribute mapping; regen; toggle and auto-fire loop; Ship HUD; PvP; escape pods; repair bills | W1 |
| W3 | Hulls and modules | 12 role hulls, Hull Designs and Refit, about 20 module families x rank steps, size scaling, icons with lit variants, store | W1, W0 |
| W4 | Perks and abilities | Six styles, Gathering space perks, space abilities and IDs | W1, W2, W0 |
| W5 | Enemies | NPC conversion, role AI, new groups, aces, encounters, spawn tables | W2, W3 |
| W6 | World | Salvage and wrecks, gas harvesting, new materials, 3 zones (Module JSON), station flags, starlanes, docking limits | W3 |
| W7 | Trade | Cargo data, exchange NUI, pricing service, HoloNet board, contraband and customs, pirates, freight contracts, factions, city tariffs, trade XP | W3, W5, W6 |
| W8 | Crew | Stations, consoles, `AttachCamera` and hidden crew, droid crew, permissions, power routing, Wing Commander crew bonuses | W2, W3, W4 |
| W9 | Crafting and rewards | Component layer and traits, recipes, research blueprints, named modules, Design Schematics, trophies and decor, ammo variants, achievements | W3, W6 |
| W10 | Migration | Rebuild Token, perk refunds, item and ship conversion, stamp cleanup, design unlocks, notices | W1, W3, W9 |
| W11 | Release | Balance pass, client evidence, docs (section 19), player release notes | All |

**Suggested order:** W0 and W1 first, then W2 and W3, then W4-W9 in parallel slices, then W10, then W11.

## 19. Verification

- **Build and tests:**
  - Build once with `-p:RunPostBuildEvent=Never -v q -clp:ErrorsOnly`.
  - Run focused NUnit filters for each slice.
  - Add tests for: rank gating, size rules, slot rows, migration (refunds, token, item mapping, ship rebuild), trade pricing and flooding, cargo spill, customs, XP split and range, PvP gating, escape pods, every auto-off trigger, support-module target locks and Retarget, All Weapons.
- **Engine tests** (`EngineTesting.md`) for:
  - Entering space with Mid slots.
  - Crew boarding, camera attach and re-attach after a starlane jump.
  - Droid crew.
  - Wrecks and salvage.
  - The saved-data item sweep.
- **Combat simulator:** extend `SWLOR.CombatSim` with the ship model (the rules are shared). Report seeded results at entry, middle and endgame ranks for:
  - Damage pilot vs tank vs support.
  - Small vs Large vs Capital under the size rules.
  - A crewed capital vs the same pilots in separate ships.
- **Client evidence** (`InEngineVisualVerification.md`) for:
  - The Mid hotbar row.
  - Lit and unlit module icons, and a module switching itself off.
  - The Ship HUD with a support module retargeted.
  - Every Hull Design at ship scale.
  - Crew camera view.
  - The exchange window.
  - The three new zones.
  - Wreck and container visuals.
  - Docking-limit messages.
- **Bible sync:** run `tools/UpdateCombatUpgradeAudit.ps1 -RefreshLocalBible` after every Bible edit. The Bible, C# descriptions, TLK and behavior must agree.
- **Docs after release:**
  - Move lasting rules into `ContentStandards.md` (hull, module and enemy standards; ship-access and docking rules) and `SkillPerkStandards.md` (space styles).
  - Fix `Builders.md`.
  - Delete this file.

## 20. Trellis2 request list

New models go through the Trellis2 pipeline (`Readmes/BlasterModelImport.md`) as a separate project. This plan ships without them.

- Space fauna: mynock swarms (latch on and drain capacitor) and a giant space slug (exogorth) in the Viscara Asteroid Belt.
- Signature Hull Designs for roles with thin model choices (Industrial, Logistics).
- Trade containers and wreck variants, if the existing placeables look wrong at ship scale.

## 21. Out of scope

- Any ground ability in space, or any space ability on the ground.
- Fuel.
- Hyperspace travel beyond starlanes.
- Tier 6 content and the reserved ores (Ochne, Croknor, Hemorgite, Bisteiss).
- New 3D models (section 20).
- Player-posted hauling contracts. Items already teleport through the bank, so they add nothing.

## 22. Risks

- **Credits:** exchanges create credits. Measure the baseline before tuning, and watch the first weeks.
- **Crew engine edge cases:** camera loss on transitions, perception range, disconnects. These need engine tests and live client evidence.
- **Content volume:** about 200 module items, 12 hulls, 6 styles, 3 zones and new enemy groups. Slice pull requests by family so reviews stay readable.
- **Migration:** every `PlayerShip` record and every space item changes. Test the item sweep on a production-sized copy before release.
- **Balance of crewed ships against fleets,** and of Small hulls at endgame. The simulator checks both before release.
