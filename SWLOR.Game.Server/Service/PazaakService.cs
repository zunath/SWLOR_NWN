/**
 * PazaakService
 * - Handles functions for collecting Pazaak cards and selecting them for a deck.
 * - Handles functions for starting and finishing a game, and tracking active games. 
 * 
 * _Card collections_
 * A player's card collection is represented as a single item in their inventory.  This has (currently) one deck, and a sideboard of unused cards.
 * Cards are acquired as separate items and "used" on the collection to add them to it.  The collection may be "used" to take one or more cards out.
 * The collection starts with a basic legal deck of 10 cards and no sideboard.  Unused cards may be swapped in to the deck in any of the 10 slots.
 * 
 * _Pazaak gameplay_
 * A Pazaak game deck has 40 cards, 10 of each value 1-10.  The objective is to get as close to 20 as possible without going over.  Players start
 * by drawing 4 cards at random from their side deck.
 * 
 * First player is chosen by a random draw from the deck.  These cards are then set aside.
 * Each player in turn, then
 * - Draws a card from the main deck.
 * - May play a card from their hand. 
 * - Decide to either End Turn or Stand.  
 *   - End Turn means you will draw in your next turn, Stand means you keep your current score. 
 *   - Hitting 20 = auto stand.
 *   - Going over 20 = bust = auto lose.
 * 
 * Repeat in turn until one player wins the set.  The winner of the set plays first in the next set.  Best of 5 sets, hand cards are not refreshed between sets.
 * If a set is tied, the set is not counted and restarts, switching first player. 
 * 
 * Other specials:
 * - 9 cards on the table without being bust = win.
 * 
 * _Other files_
 * ValueObject.PazaakGame - records information about the deck
 * Conversation.PazaakCollection - for managing a player's collection
 * Conversation.PazaakTable - for playing an actual game. 
 * 
 * Use the PazaakCollection item on yourself to manage your deck.
 * Use the PazaakCollection item on a PazaakTable to join a game.  The convo will ask whether you're playing against an NPC or waiting for another player to join.
