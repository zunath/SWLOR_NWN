                                        The main files necessary to play are distributed over NWSync. This means you can just join the server and get the files!
                                         <br />
                                        However, there are a few files which aren't distributed this way. You will need to manually install these if you would like them.
                                         <br />
                                        We highly recommend installing these for the full Star Wars experience.
